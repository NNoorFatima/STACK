for implementting a queue using stack follow this 
1- create two stacks 
2- each time you have to push an element
  if stack is empty push to top 
else
  move all elements of stack 1 to stack 2 
push element in empty stack 1 
and move back elements from stack 2 to stack 1
eg stack has elements 1 2 3 where 1 is the top
now when you insert 4 it will empty the stack insert 4 and then move 3 2 1 back 
so new stsack is 1 2 3 4
dequeue doesnt use any different logic works in the same way
